# PigeonYelp

Yelp clone created by [Lewis Moore](https://github.com/lewmoore) | [Alex Wilson](https://github.com/alextwilson) | [Simon Bao](https://github.com/simonbao) | [Alexandra Fina](https://github.com/alexandragf)

The aim of this project was to create a working clone of Yelp using Rails. We split this projects development in to three phases, MVP, Version 2 and Version 3.

Our MVP consisted of the following specifications:

* A user can create a restaurant and specify a name and description.
* A restaurant can be deleted and edited
* A user can review a restaurant with a star rating and a comment
* A restaurant displays a list of all reviews
